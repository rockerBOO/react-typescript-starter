# React Typescript Starter

React 18 starter

- Typescript 5
- Yarn 4
- Vite 5
- Vitest 2
- Biome 1
- Stylelint 15
- Testing Library React 16

This is what I currently like to use as a starter mix to make a web application. Sets up a page with React and Vite, backed with react-refresh. Tests with Jest and @testing-library.

## Install

```
yarn install
```

## Usage

```
yarn dev
```

```
yarn build
```

```
yarn test
```
