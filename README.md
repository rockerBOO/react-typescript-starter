# React Typescript Starter

React 18 starter
- Typescript 5
- Yarn 3 (node_modules linker)
- Vite 4
- ESLint 8,
- Stylelint 15,
- Jest 29
- Testing Library React 14
- Prettier 2

This is what I currently like to use as a starter mix to make a web application. Sets up a page with React and Vite, backed with react-refresh. Tests with Jest and @testing-library.

## Install

``` 
yarn install
```

## Usage

```
yarn dev
```

```
yarn build
```

```
yarn test
```
